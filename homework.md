# HOMEWORK
# JSX is a special way of writing code in react that lets you mix HTML tags directly inside your javascript code .
# and it used beacuse it wraps up multiple elements together .

# State is like a component's memory where its data has a component that can manage and change the data over time while
# pops stand for properties that are like inputs you give to a compoment like props.name .

# Hooks are special functions react give us to easily add state to our functional components.
